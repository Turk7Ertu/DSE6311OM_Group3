## Proposed Working Title:
“The Impact of Socioeconomic Factors and Municipal Spending on Public School District Performance”

### Research Question:
Given the socioeconomic challenges and educational needs that school districts cannot control, how can they best use their available resources to improve graduation rates?

### Hypothesis 
School districts can benefit from allocating more funds to student-facing resources to improve graduation rates because increased investment in areas such as teacher experience, class size, and school performance correlates with improved student outcomes and reduced dropout rates.

### Predictions:
1) School districts that spend less per pupil will have lower graduation rates.
2) School districts with a higher percentage of experienced, certified teachers will have higher graduation rates.
3) School districts meeting or exceeding state improvement targets will have higher graduation rates.
4) School districts with a lower student-to-teacher ratio will have higher graduation rates.
