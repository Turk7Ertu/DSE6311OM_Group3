### Background
Public school districts across the United States continue to face significant challenges, including budget cuts, delayed funding, and contentious contract negotiations.  These pressures often widen inequities between districts and create inconsistent opportunities for students.  Prior research has shown that outcomes such as high school graduation are closely linked to socioeconomic status as well as a district’s ability to fund schools.

**Research Question** <br>
Given the socioeconomic challenges and educational needs that school districts cannot control, how can they best use their available resources to improve graduation rates?

**Hypothesis** <br>
School districts can benefit from allocating more funds to student-facing resources to improve graduation rates because increased investment in areas such as teacher experience, class size, and school performance correlates with improved student outcomes and reduced dropout rates.

**Predictions** <br>
1) School districts that spend less per pupil will have lower graduation rates.
2) School districts with a higher percentage of experienced, certified teachers will have higher graduation rates.
3) School districts meeting or exceeding state improvement targets will have higher graduation rates.
4) School districts with a lower student-to-teacher ratio will have higher graduation rates.
