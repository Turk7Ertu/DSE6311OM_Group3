This project aims to uncover the relationship between these factors at the county level. The analysis will help policymakers allocate funds to initiatives that improve the socioeconomic status of individuals, rather than relying on unemployment insurance programs.

    1) High unemployment rate
    2) High poverty rate

### Predictions:
    1) There is negative co relation between education level and poverty level
    2) Region with lower education level exhibit high poverty levels and high employment rates.
